I volunteer with the Scienteens program in the University of Luxembourg with the stated goal of introducing scientific activities to high school students through hands-on workshops. 
To this end I wrote a [workshop](/tree/master/files/intro_python_modeling.pdf) introducing numerical simulation in physics using python scripts where students were taught about the basics of numerical programming, and were 
taught how to integrate kinematic equations using an Euler scheme. I hosted this workshop in the summer of 2023 and more recently in 2024.
