I am a theoretical researcher using numerical and analytical tools to understand self-organizing and collective behavior in microscopic systems and currently a MSCA post-doctoral fellow at the University of Luxembourg since 2023. I am particularly interested in understanding how non-equilibrium systems may lead to the emergence, be driven to, or controlled in such a way that collections of otherwise disorganized units, particles, agents etc may result in dynamic and functional behavior. To this end, I employ techniques from numerical optimization, large deviations and optimal control theory.
